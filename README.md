# Point in polygon

**Made by: Aapo Soukkio**

## Purpose of this project 

This is a Python program that checks if a given point is inside or outside a polygon using the ray-casting algorithm. The main objective is to determine the point's position relative to the polygon.

## About this project

The primary focus of this project is to provide a solution to the common problem of determining whether a given point lies inside or outside a polygon. The ray-casting algorithm is employed to accomplish this task.

In addition to the core functionality the project employs the polygenerator module to generate random polygons and utilizes the matplotlib.pyplot module to visualize the polygons and interactively classify points.

## How to run
